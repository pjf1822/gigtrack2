This is a simple app to keep track of what jobs you have worked and what you have coming up as a freelancer. In any industry. Keeps track of whether you have been paid and whether you have invoiced that company. I am using an express server with mongodb for the database. Firebase for the Auth. Firebase hides the passwords for users. When you delete you account it wipes all the gigs attached to your email address on the mongo end and the account itself on Firebase. The Mongo data object just holds a few fields. Employer name, date of gig, invoiced(boolean), paid(boolean, email address (of user), and rate to be paid for the work.
